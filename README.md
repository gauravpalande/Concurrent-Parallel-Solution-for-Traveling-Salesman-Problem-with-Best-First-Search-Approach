# Concurrent-Parallel-Solution-for-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-with-Best-First-Search-Approach
● Role: 
C# .NET, Asynchronous Programming, Multithreading, MPI Developer

● Description:
The Project attempts to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, which is NP-hard, using the Best-First-Approach (BFS) and concurrent/parallel solutions.

● PART 1:
The first part of the solution solves the TSP by implementing the BFS algorithm with a sequential approach. The project is created using C# and .NET.

● PART 2:
The second part converts the sequential approach into a parallel approach using .NET's parallel functionalities. There is a use of multithreading and thread management included in the project.

● PART 3:
The third part converts the solution by uses JAVA implemented MPI (Message Passing Interface) framework to simulate a Peer-to-Peer parallel network.
